# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Smart Garden Planner is an AI-powered web application that provides personalized plant recommendations for users based on their location, yard conditions, and preferences. The system focuses on native, climate-appropriate plants to promote sustainable gardening practices. This hackathon version prioritizes core functionality over comprehensive features, targeting a 3-hour development timeline.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a gardener, I want to input my location and yard details, so that I can receive location-specific plant recommendations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters their address THEN the system SHALL geocode the address to coordinates
2. WHEN coordinates are obtained THEN the system SHALL determine the USDA hardiness zone
3. WHEN a user selects yard direction (N/S/E/W) THEN the system SHALL map this to sun exposure levels
4. IF geocoding fails THEN the system SHALL allow manual zip code entry as fallback

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a gardener, I want to specify my gardening preferences, so that I receive plants that match my maintenance capabilities and water availability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects water availability (Low/Medium/High) THEN the system SHALL filter plants by water requirements
2. WHEN a user selects maintenance level (Low/Medium/High) THEN the system SHALL filter plants by care complexity
3. WHEN a user selects garden type (Native/Flower/Vegetable/Mixed) THEN the system SHALL prioritize appropriate plant categories
4. WHEN all preferences are selected THEN the system SHALL enable the recommendation generation

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a gardener, I want to receive AI-powered plant recommendations, so that I can make informed decisions about what to plant in my yard.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user submits location and preferences THEN the system SHALL query the AI agent with structured data
2. WHEN the AI agent processes the request THEN it SHALL return 4-6 plant recommendations
3. WHEN recommendations are generated THEN each plant SHALL include name, care requirements, and planting notes
4. WHEN current season is fall/spring THEN the system SHALL indicate which plants can be "planted now"
5. IF AI service is unavailable THEN the system SHALL return fallback recommendations from static data

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a gardener, I want to see plant details and care instructions, so that I can understand how to successfully grow the recommended plants.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN plant recommendations are displayed THEN each plant SHALL show sun, water, and maintenance requirements
2. WHEN plant recommendations are displayed THEN each plant SHALL include spacing guidelines and companion plant suggestions
3. WHEN plant recommendations are displayed THEN the system SHALL provide planting notes specific to current season
4. WHEN recommendations are shown THEN the system SHALL display the user's detected hardiness zone

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a gardener, I want to select specific plants from recommendations, so that I can customize my garden plan.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN recommendations are displayed THEN each plant SHALL have a selectable checkbox
2. WHEN a user toggles plant selection THEN the UI SHALL provide visual feedback
3. WHEN plants are selected THEN the system SHALL track the selection count
4. WHEN no plants are selected THEN plant-dependent features SHALL be disabled

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a gardener, I want to see a basic care timeline, so that I know when to perform garden maintenance tasks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN recommendations are generated THEN the system SHALL provide a seasonal care timeline
2. WHEN timeline is displayed THEN it SHALL include current season tasks
3. WHEN timeline is displayed THEN it SHALL include next season preparation tasks
4. WHEN timeline is shown THEN tasks SHALL be specific to the recommended plants
